The project requires replacing specific functionalities within the codebase using new libraries. The goal is to leverage the superior features or performance of the new libraries.

Key Steps:
1. Identify all code using the library to be replaced.
2. Learn the new library's API and best practices.
3. Map out replacement strategies for each component or module using the old library.
4. Execute the replacement, ensuring the new implementations function as intended.
5. Solve any compatibility issues arising from the new library integration.
6. Refactor the code if necessary for coherence with the new library's patterns.
7. Update or write new tests for the replaced functionalities.
8. Update documentation to reflect the library change, including new installation and usage instructions.

Documentation for each replacement should include:
1. File paths and code segments before and after replacement.
2. Rationale for selecting the new library.
3. Specific changes made during the replacement process.
4. Challenges faced and solutions implemented.
5. Impact of the replacement on the project, such as performance or usability improvements.

Maintain a detailed record of changes to facilitate future reference and maintenance. This task focuses on enhancing project capabilities through strategic library replacement. Execute systematically to ensure successful integration of the new libraries.
